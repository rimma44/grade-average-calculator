# grade-average-calculator
A simple Python program to calculate grade averages.

#  How It Works

- The `score_average` function takes four score values as input.
- It calculates the average of those scores.
- It assigns a grade based on the average using standard grading rules.

# What I Learned
Defining and using functions in Python

Performing arithmetic calculations

Applying conditional statements (if, elif, else)

Using print() to display results

# Future Improvements
 Allow user input instead of fixed values

 Accept any number of scores using lists

 Display both average and grade

 Add error handling (e.g., non-numeric inputs)
